This repository demonstrates a common issue with Firebase's `onAuthStateChanged` listener: memory leaks due to improper unsubscription.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, where the unsubscribe function isn't correctly handled, leading to the listener persisting even after the component is unmounted.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version using a cleanup function within the `useEffect` hook, ensuring proper unsubscription and preventing memory leaks.  This is crucial for maintaining application stability and performance, particularly in applications with frequent authentication changes.
